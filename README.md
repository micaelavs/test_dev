I hope you're doing well. ðŸ˜Š First and foremost, thank you for taking the time to complete this technical test. The primary goal is to understand your coding style. This is one approach (at least, the one that came to mind) to gain some insight into that aspect. Please limit yourself to a maximum of ten hours; it is not meant to be time-consuming. The focus is on how you name variables, functions, classes, your clarity in understanding object-oriented programming, and your ability to refactor code. So, please avoid overthinking the process.



*Refactor Calendar.js to Object Oriented <br />
*Consider the single responsability of SOLID principles to make the refactor<br />
*The test has to pass (already pass in the code provided)<br />

**Let's code a bit :)**
